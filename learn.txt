Why is This Important?
Understanding the menstrual cycle helps users:

Track their fertile window for pregnancy planning or contraception.
Recognize hormonal changes affecting mood, energy, and well-being.
Identify irregular cycles that could indicate underlying health issues.
Improve body literacy and confidence in reproductive health.
2. Overview of the Menstrual Cycle
What is the Menstrual Cycle?
The menstrual cycle is a monthly series of changes in a woman's body that prepares for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the uterus sheds its lining, resulting in menstruation (a period).

Average cycle length: 28 days (but can range between 21-35 days).
Phases of the cycle:

Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5)
Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)
Ovulation Phase (Day 14)
Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)
3. Phases of the Menstrual Cycle
Each phase affects a woman's body, hormones, and mood differently.

ðŸ”´ 1. Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5)
What Happens?

The uterus sheds its lining (endometrium), resulting in menstrual bleeding.
Blood, mucus, and tissues exit the body through the vagina.
Hormones Involved:

â†“ Estrogen & Progesterone â†’ Mood swings, fatigue, and cramps.
â†‘ Prostaglandins â†’ Cause uterine contractions, leading to cramps.
Common Symptoms:

Cramps, bloating, fatigue, mood swings, headaches.
Low energy, increased need for rest.
Self-Care Tips:

Stay hydrated, use heat packs for cramps.
Light exercise (yoga, stretching) can relieve discomfort.
ðŸŸ¢ 2. Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)
What Happens?

The brain signals the ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation.
The uterus starts rebuilding its lining.
Estrogen rises, leading to increased energy and positivity.
Hormones Involved:

â†‘ Estrogen â†’ Improves mood, skin, and energy.
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) â†’ Stimulates egg growth.
Common Symptoms:

Increased energy, motivation, better focus.
Improved skin, glowing complexion.
Higher libido.
Self-Care Tips:

Best time for intense workouts and productivity.
Eat protein-rich foods to support egg development.
ðŸŸ  3. Ovulation Phase (Day 14)
What Happens?

A mature egg is released from the ovary.
This is the most fertile period (highest chance of pregnancy).
Cervical mucus becomes thin and stretchy (to help sperm travel).
Hormones Involved:

â†‘ Luteinizing Hormone (LH) â†’ Triggers ovulation.
Peak Estrogen â†’ Boosts libido and attractiveness.
Common Symptoms:

Sharp pain (mittelschmerz) on one side of the abdomen.
Higher sex drive, increased confidence.
Breast tenderness, slight bloating.
Self-Care Tips:

If trying to conceive, this is the best time for intercourse.
Stay hydrated, as body temperature increases slightly.
ðŸŸ¡ 4. Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)
What Happens?

After ovulation, the body prepares for pregnancy.
If fertilization doesn't happen, hormone levels drop, leading to PMS.
Hormones Involved:

â†‘ Progesterone â†’ Increases body temperature, reduces stress.
â†“ Estrogen â†’ Leads to irritability, cravings, and mood swings.
Common Symptoms (PMS - Premenstrual Syndrome):

Mood swings, irritability, anxiety.
Food cravings, bloating, breast tenderness.
Sleep disturbances, acne breakouts.
Self-Care Tips:

Reduce caffeine and sugar to minimize PMS.
Practice stress management (meditation, deep breathing).
Magnesium-rich foods (bananas, spinach) help with mood balance.
4. Understanding Mood Swings & Emotional Changes
How Hormones Affect Mood
Phase	Mood Changes
Menstrual	Fatigue, irritability, low mood
Follicular	Optimistic, energetic, motivated
Ovulation	Confident, social, higher libido
Luteal	Moody, anxious, sensitive
AI Tip:

The app should analyze mood logs and predict patterns (e.g., "You tend to feel low 3 days before your period. Try meditation.").
5. Irregular Cycles & When to Seek Medical Advice
What is an Irregular Cycle?
A cycle that is shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.
Missed periods, extremely painful cramps, or unusual bleeding patterns.
Possible Causes of Irregular Cycles
Cause	Description
Stress	Disrupts hormones, delaying ovulation
PCOS	Irregular or missing periods, hormonal imbalance
Endometriosis	Severe cramps, heavy bleeding
Thyroid Disorders	Can make periods too long or short
When to See a Doctor?
If periods stop for more than 3 months.
Extremely heavy bleeding (changing pads/tampons every hour).
Severe cramps that interfere with daily activities.
6. Fertility & Contraception
Understanding the Fertile Window
Highest chance of pregnancy = Ovulation (Day 14 Â± 3 days).
Sperm can survive up to 5 days, meaning pregnancy is possible even if intercourse occurs before ovulation.
Types of Contraception
Method	Effectiveness
Birth Control Pills	99%
Condoms	85%
IUD (Copper or Hormonal)	99%
Fertility Awareness	75%
AI Tip:

If users track cycles for contraception, the app should highlight safe vs. high-risk days.
